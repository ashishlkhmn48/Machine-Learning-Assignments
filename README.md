# Image and Video Processing Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on image and video processing, leveraging various machine learning techniques for tasks such as background extraction, facial recognition, image classification, and sentiment analysis.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Background Extraction using Frame Averaging
- **Description**: This project implements background extraction from video frames using frame averaging combined with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for effective foreground object detection.
- **Key Techniques**: Frame Averaging, Gaussian Mixture Models, Background Subtraction.

### 2. Facial Recognition with PCA
- **Description**: Developed a facial recognition system that employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the AT&T face dataset to identify and classify facial images.
- **Key Techniques**: Principal Component Analysis, Image Processing, Face Recognition.

### 3. CNN, MLP, and VGG Transfer Learning
- **Description**: Designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architectures for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Enhanced model performance through VGG transfer learning.
- **Key Techniques**: Convolutional Neural Networks, Multilayer Perceptrons, Transfer Learning, Image Classification.

### 4. RNN and LSTM for Sentiment Analysis
- **Description**: Built a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. Experimented with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve classification performance, using Weights & Biases (wandb) for logging and monitoring.
- **Key Techniques**: Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Sentiment Analysis, Model Logging.
